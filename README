### Overview

Shadowbox is an online media viewing application that supports all of the web's
most popular media publishing formats. Shadowbox is written entirely in
JavaScript and CSS and is highly customizable. Using Shadowbox, website authors
can display a wide assortment of media in all major browsers without navigating
users away from the linking page.

For more information, please see the [Shadowbox website](http://shadowbox-js.com/).

### Usage

For detailed usage instructions, please see [the usage page](http://shadowbox-js.com/usage.html)
on the Shadowbox website.

### How to Build

A build script is provided that makes it easy to create your own custom compilations
of the Shadowbox library. Using a compiled, minimized version of the code will
reduce file size and the number of HTTP requests the client must make from your
web server. This helps your page to load faster and appear more responsive to your
users.

The Shadowbox build script is written in [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/) and uses
the [YUI Compressor](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/compressor/) to minimize the code.
Thus, you will need to have Ruby and Java installed on your machine in order to run
it. If your machine does not meet these requirements, you can always use the
[web interface](http://shadowbox-js.com/download.html) to build your script instead.

To run the script, execute the following command from the project root directory:

    $ bin/build

This creates a build with all of the default options. To see what options are
available to you, as well as their default values, use the `--help` flag:

    $ bin/build --help
