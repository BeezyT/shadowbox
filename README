Overview
--------

Shadowbox is an online media viewing application that supports all of the web's
most popular media publishing formats. Shadowbox is written entirely in
JavaScript and CSS and is highly customizable. Using Shadowbox, website authors
can display a wide assortment of media in all major browsers without navigating
users away from the linking page.

How to Build
------------

A Rake task is provided that makes it easy to create your own custom builds of
the Shadowbox code. Using a compiled, minimized version of the code will reduce
file size and the number of HTTP requests the client must make from your web
server. This helps your page to load faster and appear more responsive to your
users.

In order to run the build tasks yourself, you must have both Ruby and Java installed
on your machine. If you don't, you can always use the web interface at
http://shadowbox-js.com/download.html to build your script instead.

To build from source, edit the parameters in `tools/build.conf` that specify the
options you want to include and run the following command from the project root
directory:

    $ rake
