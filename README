Overview
--------

Shadowbox is a flexible media viewer that supports all of the web's most popular
media publishing formats. Shadowbox is written entirely in JavaScript and CSS and
is highly customizable. Using Shadowbox, website authors can display a wide
assortment of media in all major browsers without navigating users away from the
linking page.

Usage

For detailed usage instructions, please see the usage page at http://shadowbox-js.com/usage.html.

How to Build
------------

In order to build Shadowbox on your own machine you must have the Ruby programming
language (http://ruby-lang.org/) installed as well as the Rake build tool
(http://rake.rubyforge.org/). Simply edit the parameters in `build.yml` to your liking
and run the following command from the project root directory:

    $ rake

Note: If you want to build a compressed version of the code, you will also need Java
installed. Of course, you can always use the web interface on the Shadowbox website
(http://shadowbox-js.com/download.html) to build your own version of the code if you
are unable to do it on your own.
